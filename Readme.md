# Vegetable Classification Using CNN

## Project Overview
Ninjacart, India's largest fresh produce supply chain company, requires an automated system to classify vegetables in images. This project aims to build a robust classifier that can identify different types of vegetables in images and label images without a specific vegetable as noise.

## Approach
1. **Preparing and Visualizing the Dataset**
   - Collect and preprocess images of various vegetables.
   - Perform data augmentation to improve generalization.
   - Visualize sample images to understand dataset distribution.

2. **Building and Training CNN Models**
   - Implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) from scratch.
   - Define appropriate layers, activation functions, and optimizers.
   
3. **Using Callbacks to Optimize Training**
   - Implement early stopping to prevent overfitting.
   - Use learning rate reduction strategies to improve convergence.

4. **Handling Overfitting Effectively**
   - Apply dropout and batch normalization.
   - Experiment with different regularization techniques.

5. **Applying Transfer Learning for Better Accuracy**
   - Use pre-trained models like ResNet and VGGNet.
   - Fine-tune these models for vegetable classification.
   
## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV for image processing
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization
- Transfer learning models (ResNet, VGGNet)



## Results & Performance
- Compare different CNN architectures.
- Evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualize training loss and validation accuracy trends.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve model efficiency with quantization.
- Deploy as a web app using Flask or FastAPI.
- Extend dataset for better generalization.
